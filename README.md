# WIE Arduino Coding Bootcamp – 2025

Welcome to the WIE Arduino Coding Bootcamp! This one-week hybrid workshop is designed to introduce freshmen to the basics of **programming, Arduino, and ENES100-relevant robotics tools**.

This self-paced site will guide you step-by-step through **hands-on coding lessons, circuit building, and robot control**, culminating in an optional in-person demo day.

##  Workshop Purpose

Many students enter ENES100 with little to no coding experience. This program bridges that gap by:
-  Building confidence in coding and logical thinking
-  Teaching Arduino basics to support ENES100 projects


---

##  Workshop Schedule

**Virtual Days (Aug 11–14):**
-  9:00–9:10am — Icebreaker
-  9:10–11:00am — Interactive Instruction & Demos
-  11:00–12:00pm — Breakout Room Help & Coding Practice

**In-Person (Optional) – Aug 15:**
- Upload, test, and troubleshoot robot code together
- Final demos and lunch!
- Highly Recommended if you are in commuting distance!

##  What You’ll Learn

By the end of the bootcamp, you’ll be able to:

✅ Understand core programming concepts  
✅ Navigate and write code in the Arduino IDE  
✅ Use `if`, `for`, `while`, `functions`, and more  
✅ Operate an Arduino board with motors, sensors, and LEDs, and more!
✅ Feel confident coding for your ENES100 robot

##  Tools You'll Use

- **Arduino IDE** (code editor and uploader)
- **Arduino Uno**
- **Breadboard + Sensors** (Ultrasonic, LED Matrix, etc.)
- **VS Code (Optional)**
- **TinkerCAD**, **Circuit Lab**

## Acknowledgment

This boot camp was founded by **Sierra Raspa**, a former ENES100 Undergraduate Teaching Fellow, who recognized the gap in programming experience among women entering the engineering field. Her vision continues to shape this program, and her efforts remain the foundation of our mission to make coding more accessible, inclusive, and empowering for all.
