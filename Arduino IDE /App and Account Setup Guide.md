# What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) helps streamline the process of writing and executing code. It allows you to write, debug, compile, and run code in the same software, rather than using a text editor and the command line.

VScode is a very popular IDE.

# Arduino IDE Installation

# Visual Studio Code Installation 
[Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


# TinkerCad Account Setup
[Create a personal account on Tinkercad.](https://www.tinkercad.com/join) 
We'll use Tinkercad to simulate code with a virtual Arduino, practice wiring, and model different circuits. 

# GitHub Account Setup
[Optional: Create a Github account here.](https://github.com/) 
This is optional, but it's a great way to keep track of your code in a personal repository. You'll likely use GitHub throughout college for classes, clubs, and personal projects.
